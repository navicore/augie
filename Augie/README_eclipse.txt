fuck you eclipse.  seriously.  fuck you.

fyi, ddms debug port in eclipse is set to a nonesense number so it won't see anything and pop open a fucking useless window over my work.

the compile-as-you-type in eclipse is brilliant, the resource building is usable, but everything else is completely fucking insane.
